<ol>
<li>Weeks 4 and 5's projects were creating the HTML site you are on right now!
  It was a lot of learning and some fun too!</li>
<br>
<li>Week 6's project was the Contact Us page above and the jelly bean counter page on the contact us page.
  This project was fun, and I learned some great tools from it.</li>
<br>
<li>Week 7 helped us understand style sheets, and some background images and layering. </li>
<br>

<li>Weeks 9 and 10 consisted of a project  that was drawing in P5, getting elements to move within a border,
  creating shapes, and using fill and text. I enjoy using complementary colors for such
  simple graphics. Check it out below!</li>

<br>
<li>Weeks 10 through 13 consisted of a small game moving shapes around obstacles, creating obstacles with the mouse
  and giving shapes movement, speed, and variation. The game is controlled by the arrow keys, or W,A,S,D.
  Give it a try!</li>

<br>
<li> Overall, I had a ton of fun working on some of these projects. I hope you enjoy them, and that they represent
  the hard work I put in this semester! I certainly didn't know a lick of code coming into the semester, and now feel
  more confident in my understanding of how HTML works. Thanks for taking a look!</li>
