<title>A bit about beans</title>
<body>
I thoroughly enjoy jelly beans, but I am quite picky about what flavors I enjoy. I see many jelly bean flavors these days as repulsive or unnecessary, while some of the classic flavors like watermelon don't seem cool enough to captivate an audience anymore.
